A program that uses a Dynamic Programming approach to solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem. It reads in a marketprice file with a certain number of cards and their prices. And then it reads a price file with a certain capacity (where the "weight" is the price) and a certain number of cards with a lower price/weight. This program finds an optimal solution of the maximum profit I can obtain and which cards I should buy to reach the profit.
